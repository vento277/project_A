class ChatServer:
    """
    This class implements the chat server.
    It uses the socket module to create a TCP socket and act as the chat server.
    Each chat client connects to the server and sends chat messages to it. When 
    the server receives a message, it displays it in its own GUI and also sents 
    the message to the other client.  
    It uses the tkinter module to create the GUI for the server client.
    See the project info/video for the specs.
